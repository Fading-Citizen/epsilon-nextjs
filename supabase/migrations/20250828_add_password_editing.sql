  -- This function is a placeholder for the logic you'd use if you weren't using the Supabase Admin SDK.
  -- The recommended approach is using `supabase.auth.admin.updateUserById` from a trusted server environment,
  -- as it correctly handles all necessary auth schema updates.
  -- This SQL function is NOT directly used by the implemented API route, which uses the Admin SDK.
  -- It's included here for completeness in case a direct SQL-based approach is ever needed.
  -- For the API to work, ensure your server has the `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` environment variable set.
  
  -- The actual logic is handled in the API route using the Admin SDK.
  -- Example of what it might look like if you were to do it in SQL (not recommended for passwords):
  -- UPDATE auth.users SET encrypted_password = crypt(new_password, gen_salt('bf')) WHERE id = user_id;
  
  -- We leave this function empty as the API route is the correct implementation path.
  -- The presence of this file is to signify a database-level consideration of the feature.

-- Ensure the `is_admin()` function exists from previous migrations.
-- No new RLS is needed for this as the check is performed in the API route
